CONTACT INFORMATION</h3>\r\n<p>If you have any questions about this Site or our privacy policies, visit the front page of our website, scroll to the bottom, click \'contact us\' and send an email.</p>\r\n</div>','','','',6,1,'2017-08-03 16:00:00','2019-03-19 11:50:03'),(9,1,'Tagging tutorial','Tagging tutorial','<div class=\"static-wrapper\">\r\n<div class=\"section-title text-left\">\r\n<h3>How to Choose Keywords for Stock Photograph</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>We recommends having a set of \"Core Keywords\" for each image, that concisely describe the photograph whilst omitting all the many synonyms and lexically similar words. Choosing a minimal keyword set that includes the all-important Conceptual and Emotional phrases that form much of image-search these days. And the few synonyms it does supply are mainly where cross-cultural spelling differences (Aluminum :Aluminium) are concerned.</p>\r\n<p>So, if your images are not to be lost in a sea of millions of other similar images you need to be very careful which keywords you choose. Lets start by writing the Title, Caption, and Location tags. That way, we can get a proper feel for the photo and its core subject. Consider what your most important keyword is, and use it as the main word in the title, the subject and at the top of your keyword list.</p>\r\n<p>Now is also the time to consider just who you are keywording your photos for. Is it a personal project, for you to locate your own images in the future? How many words are enough? There is no one easy answer to this, as each image is different. The key is to adequately describe the image using a variety of words your buyers may think of, without getting penalized for \'spamming\' your image with keywords that simply don\'t apply to it.</p>\r\n<p>Should I include plurals? I don\'t know if there is one definitive answer to this one. Some people say yes, whilst others say no.You\'ll just have to make your own mind up here. Whatever you decide, be consistent throughout your list.</p>\r\n<p>What is the photo really about? You will have already determined that when writing the title and caption. There may be multiple uses for your photograph, so you need to decide which one is primary, which ones are secondary, and which ones are incidental. If a keyword is ultimately distracting, reject it. Put yourself in your buyer\'s shoes. If they searched for the keywords you are considering, would they be disappointed?<br /> What about concepts? This is a little more difficult to specify, but if your image can be defined as portraying an abstract or specific emotion, mood, or idea, then it is a good idea to include some words that illustrate these concepts, as these can be common search-terms.</p>\r\n<p>Maybe some common phrases? Yes, most definitely. If your image can be tied to a common expression, a catch phrase, a clich&eacute;, an idiom or a metaphor, then do include it in your list of keywords as many people are currently searching for images in precisely this way.</p>\r\n<p>Did you miss something? Although a lot of the keywords for your image will appear self-evident, it is equally important that you use a pre-defined structure that will describe the photo in terms that the professional buyer is searching for.</p>\r\n<p><strong>And a few things to remember to check once you have your keyword lists prepared:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"color:#838080;\">Check the correct spelling for all words. </li>\r\n<li style=\"color:#838080;\">Add any alternative local spellings: Florence and Firenze. </li>\r\n<li style=\"color:#838080;\">Capitalize words that should have a capital letter. Don\'t capitalize everything.</li>\r\n<li style=\"color:#838080;\">For plant and animal life try to include the scientific names, which are the same the whole world over. </li>\r\n<li style=\"color:#838080;\">If your image has space included that may be good for text placement remember to include terms like Bleed and Copy Space. </li>\r\n<li style=\"color:#838080;\">Remove all common conjunctive words (an, and, if, of, the, to, etc.) as these will be ignored by the Search Engines, and just waste space. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Ultimately, the only important question to be answered is: Can the buyers find your keyworded images, and are they selling? If yes, tweak a little. If no, tweak a lot, or take a different approach.</p>\r\n</div>','','','',7,1,'2017-08-03 16:01:38','2017-08-16 16:48:12');
